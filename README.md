# Functional Synthetic Protein Database
### A Biophysically Optimized Dataset for Training Inverse Protein Folding Models

## Overview
This repository provides a large-scale **functional synthetic protein database** constructed to enhance the training of deep learning–based **inverse protein folding** models with explicit biophysical awareness. The dataset was generated by applying **deep learning–assisted multi-objective optimization** to protein structures from the **CATH 4.3** database.

A total of **21,668 protein structures** were optimized using the **Heuristic Metropolis–Hastings Optimization (HMHO)** framework while **preserving their three-dimensional backbone geometry**. The resulting sequences exhibit substantially improved **predicted stability and solubility**, without compromising structural fidelity.

This database is designed as a **drop-in replacement** for natural protein datasets commonly used in inverse folding pipelines (e.g., PiFold, ProteinMPNN-style models), enabling a **data-centric improvement** of protein design models without architectural modification.

## Scientific Background
Inverse protein folding models are typically trained on natural protein datasets that encode structural geometry but lack explicit optimization for experimentally relevant biophysical properties such as **stability** and **solubility**. As a result, many computationally designed sequences exhibit poor folding behavior or low solubility during expression.

In the accompanying study, protein sequences from the CATH 4.3 database were optimized under **fixed 3D structures** using HMHO, a stochastic multi-objective optimization method that integrates deep learning–based sequence proposals. Each sequence was optimized with respect to:
- **Stability** (Instability Index)
- **Solubility** (NetSolP score)
- **Flexibility** (sequence-derived; included but not explicitly reported)

The optimized dataset was subsequently used to retrain the **PiFold** graph neural network architecture, yielding models that maintained sequence recovery performance while producing sequences with significantly improved biophysical profiles.

### `coords_txt/`
A directory containing **per-protein coordinate files**.

- Each file corresponds to a single optimized protein
- Atomic coordinates are stored explicitly
- Useful for:
  - Custom featurization
  - Structural validation
  - Independent coordinate-based workflows

---

### `chain_set_updated.fasta`
FASTA-formatted file containing **only the optimized amino acid sequences**.

This file is suitable for:
- Sequence-level analyses
- Downstream biophysical prediction tools
- Model evaluation independent of structure
